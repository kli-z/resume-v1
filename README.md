    - All source files in UTF-8/Unicode character encoding with Unix-style line endings (LF), entabbed with spaces (two spaces per tab)
    - Valid, well-formed semantic HTML5. Projects whose HTML does not validate with the W3C HTML validator will receive a zero-point, failing grade. In the unlikely event that you discover a validation error or warning that is a genuine bug in the validator, you must acknowledge that bug in the memo that accompanies your project, and point to the relevant documentation, such as specifications or an existing reputable bug report, that your source is in fact correct. Get in the habit early of validating your HTML before you commit to Git.
    - Only structural, semantic uses of HTML elements and attributes. Absolutely no table markup, break tags, or any other use of HTML to achieve a particular page layout. (All layout and design will be handled via CSS in the next project. For this project, I urge you not to spend much time at all looking at your pages in a browser. Stick close to your source code and the HTML validator.)
    - A semantically structured navigation area for accessing each of your projectâ€™s pages from any other page
    - Include at least two different forms of media (image, audio, video) in your project
    - Semantically structured text-based content to accompany all media elements (image, audio, video)
    - Organized, readable source that is hand-written and original (no WYSIWYGs or code-generators, no Bootstrap or other off-the-shelf frameworks)
    - Directory-based URLs with use of the default-served index.html file, so that you can point to, for example, example.com/resume/
    - A Git repository with frequent commits and meaningful commit messages that accurately reflect each set of changes that you make
    - Git repository must contain only the files and commits from this project
